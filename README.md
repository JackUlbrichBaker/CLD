### Welcome to the Can LED Driver Git repo!

This is an STM32 based Led driver that is capable of driving up to 60A at 20V (ignoring thermals)
Currently it is just a hardware repo - software TBC.  I know it is overkill but that is more fun than simplicity :seal:


- [x] Hardware schematic
- [ ] PCB routed
- [ ] PCB ordered and populated
- [ ] Software written
- [ ] software tested
